The other day I was chatting with Paco Coursey regarding this matter. Sometimes, we have devoted excessive attention to extravagant elements, disregarding the ultimate goal. The term "fancy" can be substituted with various other aspects. In general, the quality of a design does not escalate proportionally with its complexity.

Over the past few years, we have consciously abandoned embellishments such as lights, shadows, and textures in our UI designs. Nevertheless, we are now gradually reintegrating them. This shift should not be misconstrued as a regression from the era of flat design or a reembrace of skeuomorphic design; instead, it represents a progressive leap propelled by a deeper comprehension of design principles.

Good design is not about how many features you can add or how fancy you can make something look. It's about solving problems effectively while maintaining simplicity and clarity. The best designs often feel invisible - they work so well that users don't even notice the design itself.

When we focus too much on making something look impressive, we often lose sight of its purpose. A well-designed product should be intuitive, accessible, and functional first. Visual appeal is important, but it should never come at the expense of usability.
